# Methods

There are a variety of methods that are useful for modeling complex systems. Here are a few of them, along with useful links to learn more.

## Network Analysis

Network analysis is a method used to study and analyze relationships between entities within a system, represented as a network or graph. It involves examining the structure and patterns of connections among nodes (entities) and edges (relationships) in the network. This analysis provides insights into the system's organization, behavior, and properties.

In the context of complex systems, network analysis helps identify key elements, patterns of interaction, and emergent properties. It is applied in various fields such as social science, biology, transportation, and information systems. For example, in social networks, it can reveal influential individuals or communities. In biological systems, it can uncover protein interactions. The application of network analysis facilitates a better understanding of the dynamics and functioning of complex systems.

George Mason University has made a nicely organized guide available for learning the basic concepts and tools: https://infoguides.gmu.edu/networkanalysis/getstarted

## Agent Based Modeling

Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a simulation technique used to model complex systems by representing individual agents and their interactions. In ABM, agents are autonomous entities with specific characteristics and behaviors. The model simulates how these agents interact with each other and their environment over time, leading to emergent system-level patterns.

The application of ABM to complex systems allows for a more granular understanding of how individual entities contribute to the overall system behavior. It is particularly useful when dealing with systems where heterogeneity, adaptation, and interactions between entities play a crucial role. Examples of applications include studying traffic flow, economic dynamics, ecosystems, and social dynamics.

Two great resources for learning ABM are the Netlogo and Mesa courses on Santa Fe Institute's Complexity Explorer:
