# Foundations

One of the best starting points for understanding what is meant by "complexity" is P.W. Anderson's seminal paper _More is Different_. Speaking of the limitations of reductionism, Anderson explains,

>The ability to reduce everything to simple fundamental laws does not imply the ability to start from those laws and reconstruct the universe. In fact, the more the elementary particle physicists tell us about the nature of the fundamental laws, the less relevance they seem to have to the very real problems of the rest of science, much less to those of society.

This sets the stage for the concept of emergence and the ineffectiveness of simple extrapolation across scales.
